# DenoisingAutoEncoders-StackedEncoders
Autoencoders are feedforward neural networks where input are same as the output. These are dimensionality reduction/compression Algorithm
## AUTO ENCODERS
Autoencoders are a specific type of feedforward neural networks where the input is the same as theoutput. They compress the input into a lower-
dimensional space and then reconstruct the output from this representation.
